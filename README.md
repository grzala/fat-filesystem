Simulation of a FAT16 Filesystem that implements creating, reading and writing files and directories, absolute and relative paths and copying files. Makefile compiles a program showing the potential use of the filesystem. Use hexdupm to read the filesystem. Filesys.c contains functions used by the filesystem. Shell.c is an example usage of the filesystem.
